"Power BI project featuring real-time SQL Server integration, enabling dynamic updates to dashboards as new data is added. The project includes advanced data modeling and visualization, utilizing DAX for calculated measures and insights. Designed for scalability and seamless data-driven decision-making."




This repository contains a Power BI project that connects to a SQL Server database to create dynamic and insightful dashboards. The integration with SQL Server ensures that as new data is added to the database, the dashboards automatically update, providing real-time insights.

## Features

- **SQL Server Connection**: The project is connected to a SQL Server database, allowing for seamless data updates and maintenance. As new data is added to the database tables, the Power BI dashboard reflects these changes without manual intervention.
  
- **DAX Calculations**: The project includes several DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) calculations to enhance the data analysis, including custom measures and calculated columns that add depth to the reports.

- **Interactive Dashboards**: The dashboards are designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into the data to uncover deeper insights.

## Getting Started

To explore the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Power BI (.pbix) file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Ensure you have access to the SQL Server database used in the project.
4. Refresh the data connections to see the latest data reflected in the dashboards.

## Future Updates

The project is designed to be scalable, allowing for easy addition of new data to the SQL Server database. As new data is added, the dashboards will update automatically to include the latest information.
